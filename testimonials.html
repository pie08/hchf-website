                "I am a 70 year old male and had rotator cuff repair surgery
                November 2021. After the repair my surgeon advised me not to
                return to work for 3 months. I had 6 months of Physical Therapy
                and was diligent with my at home exercises. I returned to the
                gym 4 months after surgery. After 6 months in the gym I returned
                to a fitness level that seemed similar to that previous to my
                injury. Last summer I tried to surf a few times, an activity I
                have enjoyed for 20 years. My paddling was "OK" but I was not
                able to pop up. I knew then that in spite of the physical
                therapy and my time in the gym my shoulder was not right.
                Fortunately last Ocober a friend of mine recommended Abie. She
                has been seeing him along with her sons for 10 years. I have
                been working with Abie for 6 months now 3 times a week. 2 days
                is primarily weight lifting with some stretching and the third
                day is cardio and conditioning. Abie is a terrific trainer. He
                is patient, upbeat and encouraging. He designs individual
                workouts that have evolved in concert with my changing fitness
                level. He is totally focused and an active participant in each
                workout. He has a wonderful sense for the number of repetitions
                and the amount of weight I can handle for each exercise. All
                sessions are 1:1 with correct technique and the prevention of
                injury the number one priority. Physical therapy and time in the
                gym are great after surgery but not always sufficient to return
                to a level of fitness required for some activities. Thanks to
                Abie I am hoping to get back in the water this summer and enjoy
                surfing again".

                "After completing Physical Therapy for rotator cuff surgery, I
                was still experiencing discomfort, weakness, and limited range
                of motion in my shoulder. My wife trains with Abie and she
                recommended I see him. Since working with Abie, I have full
                range of motion again in my shoulder. Abie focuses on the entire
                body, not just the surgically repaired areas. I have seen
                substantial strength improvements in my entire body,
                particularly in my legs".

                "I have been training with Abie Berggren for 5 + years now. My
                training was interrupted on October 14, 2019 when I was struck
                by a Suburban and I had to have shoulder replacement surgery.
                For 9 months, I was only able to do Physical Therapy, I was then
                given the green light to go back to my trainer. As helpful as PT
                was, I would have never improved to where I am now without the
                training of Abie. He encouraged me when I thought I could not do
                it. He pushed me to the next level with safety always a top
                priority. Abie's expertise in my situation mixing mobility with
                strengthening has been invaluable. I started out with a 3lb
                dumbbell weight and am now up to 25lbs. lf you have had some
                sort of sports injury, or are looking to improve your overall
                strength and stamina, I would highly recommend Abie Berggren".

                "Abie is very knowledgeable, diverse, and effective at his
                craft. I initially began training with Abie to improve my
                overall health. In short time, I became much stronger, stable
                and mobile, and eventually lost over 30lbs with the assistance
                of Abie's nutritional advice."<br /><br />"After many years of
                putting off knee-replacement surgery, it suddenly became clear
                that it was time. Abie was instrumental in helping me prepare
                for post-surgical rehab and then continuing the rehabilitation
                process after Physical Therapy expired. I steadily progressed
                into more advanced movements over time to continually improve
                the strength and stability of my surgically repaired knee as
                well as the rest of my body. My overall body composition has
                changed for the better and people have noticed!"
