            continue to experience; Discomfort, Limited Range of Motion, Lack of

            They are also uncertain how to effectively continue the recovery
            process. I will Effectively Guide You by addressing the limitations
            in the surgically repaired area while implementing timely

              "I am a 70 year old male and had rotator cuff repair surgery
              November 2021. After the repair my surgeon advised me not to
              return to work for 3 months. I had 6 months of Physical Therapy
              and was diligent with my at home exercises. I returned to the gym
              4 months after surgery. After 6 months in the gym I returned to a
              fitness level that seemed similar to that previous to my injury.
              Last summer I tried to surf a few times, an activity I have
              enjoyed for 20 years. My paddling was "OK" but I was not able to
              pop up. I knew then that in spite of the physical therapy and my
              time in the gym my shoulder was not right. Fortunately last Ocober
              a friend of mine recommended Abie. She has been seeing him along
              with her sons for 10 years. I have been working with Abie for 6
              months now 3 times a week. 2 days is primarily weight lifting with
              some stretching and the third day is cardio and conditioning. Abie
              is a terrific trainer. He is patient, upbeat and encouraging. He
              designs individual workouts that have evolved in concert with my
              changing fitness level. He is totally focused and an active
              participant in each workout. He has a wonderful sense for the
              number of repetitions and the amount of weight I can handle for
              each exercise. All sessions are 1:1 with correct technique and the
              prevention of injury the number one priority. Physical therapy and
              time in the gym are great after surgery but not always sufficient
              to return to a level of fitness required for some activities.
              Thanks to Abie I am hoping to get back in the water this summer
              and enjoy surfing again".

              "After completing Physical Therapy for rotator cuff surgery, I was
              still experiencing discomfort, weakness, and limited range of
              motion in my shoulder. My wife trains with Abie and she
              recommended I see him. Since working with Abie, I have full range
              of motion again in my shoulder. Abie focuses on the entire body,
              not just the surgically repaired areas. I have seen substantial
              strength improvements in my entire body, particularly in my legs".

              "I have been training with Abie Berggren for 5 + years now. My
              training was interrupted on October 14, 2019 when I was struck by
              a Suburban and I had to have shoulder replacement surgery. For 9
              months, I was only able to do Physical Therapy, I was then given
              the green light to go back to my trainer. As helpful as PT was, I
              would have never improved to where I am now without the training
              of Abie. He encouraged me when I thought I could not do it. He
              pushed me to the next level with safety always a top priority.
              Abie's expertise in my situation mixing mobility with
              strengthening has been invaluable. I started out with a 3lb
              dumbbell weight and am now up to 25lbs. lf you have had some sort
              of sports injury, or are looking to improve your overall strength
              and stamina, I would highly recommend Abie Berggren".

              "Abie is very knowledgeable, diverse, and effective at his craft.
              I initially began training with Abie to improve my overall health.
              In short time, I became much stronger, stable and mobile, and
              eventually lost over 30lbs with the assistance of Abie's
              nutritional advice."<br /><br />"After many years of putting off
              knee-replacement surgery, it suddenly became clear that it was
              time. Abie was instrumental in helping me prepare for
              post-surgical rehab and then continuing the rehabilitation process
              after Physical Therapy expired. I steadily progressed into more
              advanced movements over time to continually improve the strength
              and stability of my surgically repaired knee as well as the rest
              of my body. My overall body composition has changed for the better
              and people have noticed!"
